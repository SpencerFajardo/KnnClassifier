# KnnClassifier
This was a class project where we built a GUI to display the results of using a KNN Classifier on data.
To use this GUI, run the ClassifierGUI class. Then, load the faces folder. After the face pictures have
been loaded to the GUI, you can click on any picture and it will classify the picture as smiling,
neutral, or suprised. It classifies them by polling the closest N pictures, and having a majority vote
decide what the 'unknown' picture is. You can adjust the N value with the slider.
